# nRF52_sandbox
Prototype BLE module breakout

We have been using the BC127 Bluetooth radio module, but that has gone EOL.
We are going to replace it with an nRF52840 module
Module: MDBT50Q-1MV2 made by Raytac
This is used by Adafruit in their development boards.
We will be targeting "Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express"

This design is to proove that we can flash the bootloader and build firmware.
